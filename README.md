# 3d-trapezoid-prism
3d trapezoid prism is a program that will draw a prism and the user using specific keys
can scale the height of the prism, rotate it to z-axis or x-axis and zoom in or zoom out.
Specifically, with keys <u> and <p> the height of the prism will be scaled up and scaled down,
with keys <w> και <x> prism will be rotated to x-axis and with <q> και <z> to z-axis and keys <+> και <->
will zoom in/out.The program is in C++/C with the use of Opengl 3.3+.
